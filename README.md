# Analysis of Central Bank Rates On Investment and Inflation

This analysis focuses on central bank interest rates as the metric explaining investment, investment inflow, investment outflow, and inflation. Choosing interest rates are a core component of monetary policy used by central banks to influence investment and inflation. The inflow and outflow investment metrics are to see how foreign investors respond with changes to domestic monetary policy.

The analysis can be viewed in this [link](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Shane-Lester100/Macroeconomic-Investigation/blob/master/Macroeconomic%20Variable%20Investigation%20.ipynb).

Five datasets in total are in this analysis, all from the data site `gapminder.org`. For more information on the datasets, read the data wrangling section in the link above to understand what the exact datasets are and how they were processed.

Lastly, there is an environment.yaml file to reproduce the analysis.
